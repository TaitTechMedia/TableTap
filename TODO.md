- Add gitignore for TODO.md and tools directory

- Figure out how to have the site clear the cache and create a new one whenever it is online, as when I delete stuff, I wan't it removed and not to have to clear the freaking browser!

- Add a mechanism to add your own games if you have PWA installed and make sure clearing cache, doesn't affect this (including manually clearing Chrome cookies)?
